## Week 4

Tried a lot of different models.

baseline models for trying to predict price movement for the next hour. All done with dataset_draft1, which has stock movement indicators
on the daily basis.

LSTM
	30 lag hours - accuracy 50%
	100 lag hours - accuracy 50%
	
SVM (though not really)
	30 lag hours - accuracy 50%

Random Forest (1000 estimators)
	30 lag hours - accuracy 50%
	100 lag hours - accuracy 50%

Probably not a problem with not enough data, as we had 40000 rows, just more that thereâ€™s too much noise and not enough features
that explain random movements. It might not be enough data if we decide to lag all the features, as that leads to a sqaure matrix... but
not sure. Other experiments indicate that accuracy with my current dataset using random forest can give 68% accuracy, if it's looking at prediction for the price movement of next day.
