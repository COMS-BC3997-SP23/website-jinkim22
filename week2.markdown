Created a script for generating a spreadsheet with 20 stock price movement indicators, and feature expansions on selected features.
Started building framework for feeding data into LSTM, random forest classifications, and regressions to try and predict binary movement of price, and price forecasts.
All parameters for indicators were given straight from a research paper. lstm_stock_pred_research_paper.pdf in my repo.
