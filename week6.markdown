## Week 6

Got the basic mean reversion algorithm running in the back on VM from Google Cloud. Created the infrastructure ofr the whole bot such that it
works with the live data, and algorithm is triggered every 20 minutes.
Also coded portfolio rebalncing with Sharpe Ratio, but yet to use because
better option may be available with https://pypi.org/project/pyportfolioopt/
