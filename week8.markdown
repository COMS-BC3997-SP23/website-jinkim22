## Week 8

We worked on moving the trading bot to a real-time data system. 
Using https://alpaca.markets/data
Fetch streaming market data via Websockets
Got it working thru terminal to fetch the data
Started implementing in Python
However, it is useless to implement real-time data streaming without an algo that works effectively in the short-term; aka. the trades that would be made probably will not change
