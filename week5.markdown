## Week 5

From experimenting with various short-term (intraday) price prediction models, we were unable to create a model that produced reliable hourly predictions that were in any way usable.

However, from experimentation and reading various research papers, we determined that it is possible to create relatively accurate predicitions for day-to-day prices for the near future. 

Explored use of apache airflow to orchestrate the data processing pipeline.
