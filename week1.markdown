## Week 1

This week was primarily dedicated to refining the idea and completing the project proposal. After performing a deep-dive into the specifications, we had made some changes from initially thought; we switched to creating a trading bot for cryptocurrency, rather than for the stock market. This was due to the crypto market being based less on fundamentals, so we can focus on analyzing chart trends. Further, it is also possible to trade at any time of the day, rather than during specific trading hours.
